# Project To Dos

## To Dos to Implement
- make functions for repetitive code
    - hosts
    - secpol
- Group Policy Script (set according to CIS policy)
- Move Asking for Users and Admins to Scripts (so that is skipped if we do not need to ask)
    - also this script needs to list each user in the file on a separate line, not one line like: `Administrator Guest`

## Known Issues to Fix
- Remove Startup Items 
    - error if all items are empty
    - Doesn't function? I'm not completely sure at this point.
- Group Policy script is nonfunctional
- hacking tools second script cannot find file specified
